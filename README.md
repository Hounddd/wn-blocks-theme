# Winter CMS - Blocks Theme
Winter CMS theme that demonstrates the use of "repeater groups" in [custom page fields](https://github.com/wintercms/wn-pages-plugin/blob/main/docs/documentation.md#custom-page-fields) to assemble static pages with customizable building sections and blocks.
Each section, depending on his type, can have one or more blocks.

## Installation
(let assume you're in the root of your winter installation)

### Using composer
Just run this command
```
composer require hounddd/wn-blocks-theme
```

### Cloning repo
Clone this repo into your winter themes folder.

```
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/liip/oc-blocks-theme.git blocks
```
## Usage
NOTE: the name **blocks** is important, if you change the themes name you have to alter some files to match the path.
 - the groups attribute in the `layouts/default.htm` repeater.
 - the groups attribute in the `meta/sections.yaml` repeater.


In your backend, check for the [static pages plugin](https://github.com/wintercms/wn-pages-plugin) to be installed. If you go to the "Pages" and edit home page, you now have a blocks tab where you can add different sections/blocks, enter data and even rearrange their order.
Custom page fields add custom fields to the page editor form, called *Syntax Fields*

## Adjust to your needs
See [Winter CMS backend forms](https://wintercms.com/docs/backend/forms) documentation to see how setting new field definitions.
### Adding sections
To add more section types, edit `meta/sections.yaml` file.

In your field definition simply add
```
my-section-type:
    name: My awesome section
    description: display a section
    icon: icon-table
    content:
        type: repeater
        prompt: Add new block
        style: accordion
        groups: themes/blocks/meta/blocks.yaml
```
**Important**: Each section definition has a corresponding partial file named `partials/blocks/{section_name}.htm`.  The form data is passed as 'data'.

### Adding blocks
To add more block types, edit `meta/blocks.yaml` file.

In your field definition simply add
```
text:
    name: Simple text
    description: simple text without html tags
    icon: icon-file-text-o
    fields:
        content:
            label: Content
            span: left
            type: textarea
            size: small
```
**Important**: Each block definition has a corresponding partial file named `partials/blocks/content/{block_name}.htm`.  The form data is passed as 'content'.

**Make awesome sites with Winter!**
